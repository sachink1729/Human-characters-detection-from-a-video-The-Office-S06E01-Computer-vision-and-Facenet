# Human-characters-detection-from-a-video-The-Office-S06E01-Computer-vision-and-Facenet
This is a self mini project that I undertook for my learning process. I have taken an episode from my favourite TV series called The Office (US) S06E01. Using this episode I have extracted images &amp; using those images I have classified 17 characters using CV2 and Facenet Model.
